# Human Rsources Management System

* _The repo is missing the DB and the .env file used by pyhton-decouble to populate the settings for it & the app secure key_
* The default setup uses a remote postgres DB but it will also work with sqlite, no special postgres query methods like distinct() were used
* A sample data set is provided in excel format that can populated in the DB for testing
